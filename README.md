## 📋 Overview

**API Monitoring** is a production-ready, enterprise-grade monitoring solution designed specifically for AWS-compatible cloud APIs. Built with modern asynchronous Python architecture, it provides real-time monitoring, intelligent alerting, and comprehensive network diagnostics to ensure your cloud infrastructure remains highly available.

### 🎯 Problem Statement

Cloud API downtime can cost businesses thousands of dollars per minute. Traditional monitoring solutions often lack:
- **Real-time detection** of API failures
- **Intelligent maintenance mode** handling
- **Comprehensive network diagnostics** when issues occur
- **Immediate notification** to the right teams
- **Automated resolution tracking**

### 💡 Solution

API Monitoring addresses these challenges by providing:
- **Continuous monitoring** of AWS-compatible APIs with configurable intervals
- **Smart maintenance detection** that prevents false alerts during planned downtime
- **Instant Telegram alerts** with detailed MTR network traces for rapid troubleshooting
- **Automatic resolution notifications** when services recover
- **Production-ready deployment** with Docker and systemd support

### 🏢 Use Cases

- **DevOps Teams**: Monitor critical cloud infrastructure APIs
- **SRE Teams**: Ensure SLA compliance with real-time alerting
- **Cloud Providers**: Monitor service availability across regions

## 📦 Installation

### 📋 Prerequisites

- 🐍 Python 3.13+
- 🌐 MTR (My Traceroute) tool

### Option 1: 🐍 Standard Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dkamenkov/api-monitoring.git
cd api-monitoring
```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install the MTR tool:
   - On Ubuntu/Debian:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install mtr
     ```
   - On CentOS:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install mtr
     ```

### Option 2: 🐳 Docker Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dkamenkov/api-monitoring.git
cd api-monitoring
```

2. Build and run with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 📝 Environment Setup

1. Copy the example configuration file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your specific settings:

### 🔧 Required Configuration

```bash
# API Endpoint Configuration
ENDPOINT_URL=https://api.your-cloud-provider.com
# The AWS-compatible API endpoint to monitor (without trailing slash)

# AWS Credentials
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
# Your AWS access key ID with EC2 permissions

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
# Your AWS secret access key

AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
# AWS region for API calls (must match your endpoint region)

# Telegram Configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz
# Bot token from @BotFather on Telegram

TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=123456789
# Your Telegram chat ID (get from @userinfobot)
```

### ⚙️ Optional Configuration

```bash
# Monitoring Intervals (in seconds)
CHECK_INTERVAL=60
# How often to check the API (recommended: 60-300 for production)

API_TIMEOUT=15
# Timeout for API requests (recommended: 10-30 seconds)

MAINTENANCE_CHECK_TIMEOUT=10
# Timeout for maintenance mode detection (recommended: 5-15 seconds)

# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
# Logging verbosity: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

LOG_FILE=logs.log
# Log file path (set to empty string to disable file logging)
```

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

- **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
- **Use IAM roles** when running on AWS EC2 instead of access keys
- **Rotate credentials regularly** and use least-privilege access
- **Restrict Telegram bot** to specific chats only
- **Use environment-specific** configurations for different deployments

### 🏢 Enterprise Configuration

For enterprise deployments, consider:

```bash
# Advanced Settings
CHECK_INTERVAL=30          # More frequent checks for critical systems
API_TIMEOUT=10            # Shorter timeout for faster detection
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING         # Reduce log verbosity in production
LOG_FILE=""               # Disable file logging, use centralized logging
```

### 🐳 Docker Configuration

When using Docker, you can override settings via environment variables:

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  api-monitoring:
    environment:
      - CHECK_INTERVAL=30
      - LOG_LEVEL=WARNING
      - LOG_FILE=""
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 🚫 "MTR is not installed" Error
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install mtr-tiny

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install mtr

# Alpine Linux (Docker)
apk add --no-cache mtr
```

#### 🔑 AWS Credentials Issues
- Ensure AWS credentials have EC2 permissions
- Verify the endpoint URL is correct and accessible
- Check if the region matches your AWS setup

#### 📱 Telegram Notifications Not Working
- Verify bot token is correct and bot is active
- Ensure chat ID is correct (use @userinfobot to get your chat ID)
- Check if bot has permission to send messages to the chat

#### 🐳 Docker Container Issues
```bash
# Check container logs
docker-compose logs -f api-monitoring

# Restart container
docker-compose restart api-monitoring

# Rebuild with latest changes
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### 🔧 High Memory Usage
- Reduce `CHECK_INTERVAL` if set too low
- Check for memory leaks in logs
- Consider resource limits in Docker deployment

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Set in .env file
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Or as environment variable
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python -m api_monitoring.main
```

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What APIs are supported?**
A: Any AWS EC2-compatible API that supports the `describe_availability_zones` operation. This includes AWS, OpenStack, and many private cloud solutions.

**Q: How often should I set the check interval?**
A: For production systems, 60-300 seconds is recommended. For critical systems, 30-60 seconds. Avoid intervals below 30 seconds to prevent API rate limiting.

**Q: Can I monitor multiple APIs?**
A: Currently, each instance monitors one API endpoint. Deploy multiple instances with different configurations for multiple endpoints.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What network ports are required?**
A: Outbound HTTPS (443) for API calls and Telegram notifications. MTR requires ICMP and UDP for network tracing.

**Q: How much bandwidth does it use?**
A: Minimal - typically less than 1MB per day for standard monitoring intervals.

**Q: Is it suitable for production use?**
A: Yes, it's designed for production with proper error handling, logging, and deployment options.

**Q: Can I extend the alerting to other channels?**
A: Yes, the alerting system is modular. See the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for extending to Slack, Discord, or email.

### Configuration Questions

**Q: How do I get a Telegram bot token?**
A: Message @BotFather on Telegram, create a new bot, and copy the provided token.

**Q: How do I find my Telegram chat ID?**
A: Message @userinfobot on Telegram, or add your bot to a group and check the logs for the chat ID.

**Q: Can I use IAM roles instead of access keys?**
A: Yes, when running on AWS EC2, the application will automatically use IAM instance profiles if no explicit credentials are provided.
