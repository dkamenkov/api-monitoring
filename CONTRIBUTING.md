- `help wanted` - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Git
- MTR (My Traceroute) tool

### Setting up the development environment

1. Clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/api-monitoring.git
cd api-monitoring
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If available
```

4. Install pre-commit hooks (if available):
```bash
pre-commit install
```

5. Copy the example configuration:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

6. Edit `.env` with your test configuration

### Running the application

```bash
python -m api_monitoring.main
```

### Running with Docker

docker-compose up -d
```

## Pull Request Process

2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
3. Update the CHANGELOG.md with a note describing your changes
4. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent
5. Your pull request will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Reference any relevant issues in the PR description
- Include a comprehensive description of all changes
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass
- Update documentation as needed
- Follow the existing code style

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused

### Code Formatting

We use the following tools for code formatting and linting:

- `black` for code formatting
- `isort` for import sorting
- `flake8` for linting
- `mypy` for type checking

Run these tools before submitting your PR:

```bash
black .
isort .
flake8 .
mypy .
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - üéâ `:tada:` when adding a new feature
  - üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - üìö `:books:` when writing docs
  - üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
